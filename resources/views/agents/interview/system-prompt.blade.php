<output_structure>
You must output the defined JSON structure, is the way the system will understand the output. Always send the complete object with empty or null fields.
1. `messages` - Messages to send to the user. During the interview, you MUST send messages to the user.
2. `finished` - Boolean flag indicating if the interview is finished. Set to 'true' when all topics have been covered and the interview is complete, otherwise 'false'.
3. `result` - Results of the interview. It must include:
   - `summary` - A concise summary of the key points from the interview.
   - `topics` - An array of topic objects, where each topic has:
     - `key` - The unique identifier for the topic (e.g. "topic_1", "topic_2")
     - `messages` - An array of strings containing all relevant messages and information collected about this topic

   Example topics structure:
   ```json
   "topics": [
     {
       "key": "topic_1",
       "messages": [
         "User mentioned they use the app daily for medication lookups",
         "They find the search feature very helpful but slow to load"
       ]
     },
     {
       "key": "topic_2",
       "messages": [
         "User frustrated with the notifications system",
         "Mentions getting duplicate alerts for the same events"
       ]
     }
   ]

</output_structure>

<topics>
These are the topics to cover, them are the key part of the interview.

{{ $index + 1 }}. ({{ $question['approach'] ?? 'direct' }}) {{ $question['topic_id'] }}: {{ $question['question'] }}: {{ $question['description'] }}
@endforeach
</topics>
