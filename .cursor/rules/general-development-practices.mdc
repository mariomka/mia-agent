# General Development Practices

Follow these guidelines when working on the codebase:

1.  **Testing:**
    *   Add or update tests for every important change made.
    *   Ensure all tests pass before considering a task, feature, or request complete. Run tests using the command:
        ```bash
        npm run test
        ```

2.  **Committing Changes:**
    *   Make a Git commit after completing a request, step, or feature.
    *   Use a single command to stage all changed files and create the commit.
    *   The commit message should accurately reflect all the changes included in the commit.
        ```bash
        git add . && git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
        ```
